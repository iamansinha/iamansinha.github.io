Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student in [Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). Along with this, I'm a graduate research assistant at [Scientific Computing & Imaging Institute](https://sci.utah.edu/) at University of Utah. I'm advised by [Mike Kirby](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~kirby) and [Shandian Zhe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/).

Previously, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Physics at [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/) in India, with a minor in Computational & Data Sciences (CDS). There, I did my master's thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Dwaipayan Roy](https://dwaipayanroy.github.io/) in the topic of retrieval biases and fairness of different information retrieval (IR) models. During my bachlor's and master's, I was also especially interested and exposed to Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning through coursework and IBM Summer Schools.

### My Research Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning models for language understanding and mathematical & physical reasoning capabilities. Since current ML predictions lack proper grasp of physical laws of our world, my PhD is focusing on Physics-informed ML to better model physical systems of research interest. In the long run, I want AI models to be able to understand mathematics-intensive research papers and be able to assist researchers in making new scientific discoveries.

- [Nov 2023] Our short paper "[A Comparative Analysis of Retrievability and PageRank Measures](https://doi.org/10.1145/3632754.3632760)" accepted at FIRE 2023!

- [Aug 2023] Our short paper "[Findability: A Novel Measure of Information Accessibility](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583780.3615256)" accepted at CIKM 2023!

- [June 2023] Graduated from IISER Kolkata, India with a BS-MS in Physics (major) and Computational & Data Sciences (minor)!

- [May 2023] Defended my master's thesis titled "[Retrivability in IR](/files/Aman_Sinha_MS_Project_Report_18MS065.pdf)". I'm indebted and thankful to my supervisor [Dr. Dwaipayan Roy]() - it has been a great research experience under his supportive guidance!
