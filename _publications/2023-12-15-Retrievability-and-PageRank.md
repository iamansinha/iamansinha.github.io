In this short paper, we explore any potential correlation between *Retrievability* measure and *PageRank* measure, and report the results. We find that, even though the correlation is very low, the larger corpus gives higher correlation value between the 2 corpora experimented on. We find a considerable value of Ranked Biased Overlap (RBO) between Retrievability and PageRank, which hints us toward the potential of retrievability measure in its potential use for document weighting. <br><br>
