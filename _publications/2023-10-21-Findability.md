In this paper, we introduce the concept of *findability* under the unbrella of Information Accessibility and propose a novel systematic method to measure this new and more useful measure of information accessibility. We perform experiments to show that it is uncorrelated with an another measure *retrivability* from which findability takes inspiration to improve. <br><br>
